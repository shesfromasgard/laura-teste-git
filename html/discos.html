                    <p>Blackpink released their debut single album Square One in August 2016, which includes the songs "Whistle" and Boombayah". "Whistle" debuted atop the Gaon Digital Chart while "Boombayah" became the group's first number-one hit on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart. The group continued their success with the release of Square Two on November 1, 2016. The single album includes "Playing with Fire", which sold more than 2.5 million digital copies in South Korea and became Blackpink's second number-one hit on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart. Square Two peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart and number two on the World Albums chart.</p>
                        
                    <p>In June 2017, the group released their fifth single, "As If It's Your Last", which became the group's third song to reach 2,500,000 certified downloads in South Korea (after "Whistle" and "Playing with Fire") and their third number-one hit on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart (after "Boombayah" and "Playing with Fire"). In August of the same year, Blackpink made their Japanese debut with their EP Blackpink, which featured Japanese-language editions of the group's existing tracks at the time. The EP was a commercial success, debuting atop the Oricon chart and selling over 80,000 copies in Japan.</p>
                        
                    <p>In June 2018, the group released their first Korean EP, Square Up, which debuted atop the Gaon Album Chart. Square Up peaked at number 40 on the Billboard 200, and spawned the hit single "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du", which spent three weeks atop the Gaon Digital Chart. "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" was also the group's first song to enter the Billboard Hot 100, debuting and peaking at number 55, and their fourth on the World Digital Song Sales chart. As of April 2019, the single has achieved a platinum certification for both streaming and downloads within South Korea.

Kill This Love peaked at number 24 on the Billboard 200, making them the highest-charting female Korean act on the chart. The EP's lead single, "Kill This Love," peaked at number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking the group's third hit to enter the chart and extending their record for the most entries and longest-charting single of a female Korean act on the chart. It also became the group's fifth single to chart at number one on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart.</p>
                        
                    <p>In June 2020, Blackpink released "How You Like That" as a pre-release single from the group's debut Korean studio album The Album. The song spent three weeks atop the Gaon Digital Chart and debuted at number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100, tying with the group's collaboration with American singer Lady Gaga, "Sour Candy", as the highest-charting songs by a female act on the Hot 100. The group subsequently released the second pre-release single “Ice Cream" featuring American singer Selena Gomez on August 28, which peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the highest-charting as well as the longest-charting song by a female Korean act on the chart. On October 2, 2020, The Album was released alongside title track “Lovesick Girls", which peaked at number two on both the Billboard Global 200 and the Gaon Digital Chart. The album debuted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart and broke the record for the best-selling album by a Korean female act of all time, selling over 1 million copies in its first month.
